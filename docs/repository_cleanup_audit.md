# Repository cleanup audit — Phase 1 (read-only) + post-refactor record

Audit date: 2026-09-15.  Post-refactor record added 2026-09-17 (Phase 8
execution).  Scope is the current `main` worktree only.  The audit deliberately
makes no move, deletion, or algorithm change; its purpose is to establish the
immutable pre-refactor contract and the proof obligations for later phases of
the competition-delivery refactor.

> **Post-refactor status (2026-09-17).**  The canonical refactor (Tasks 1-9 of
> `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-15-competition-delivery-refactor.md`) completed:
> canonical raw preprocessing/features moved to `src/pipeline/`, the raw
> `Predictor` API and four-way boundary parity are in place, `dist/inference`
> and `dist/submission` are generated clean-room packages, and the audited
> historical-experiment files were removed.  **The deletion ledger is
> `tests/fixtures/deletion_manifest.json`**: it enumerates every removed path
> with six consumer proofs (imports/tests/reproduction/release/submission/
> references), enforced by `tests/release/test_repository_hygiene.py`.  Deleted
> files remain recoverable from git history.  Kept by dependency closure (not
> used by the promoted pipeline, but imported by the raw-62 fixture or the
> parity tests): the historical slide producer/verifier pair, the official
> matching module, and the ranker-eval pair it imports.  `dist/event_stack`
> (serialized-payload runtime) stays as release evidence; all new integration
> uses `dist/inference`.

## Immutable baseline: `CURRENT_PROMOTED_RELEASE`

`CURRENT_PROMOTED_RELEASE` is **`160afaf81debf1ee`**.  It is established by
the tracked incumbent registry `release/event_stack_incumbent.json`, whose
run key, aggregate F1, summary hash and attestation hash agree with
`models/event_stack/160afaf81debf1ee/`.

The deployment manifest has source fingerprints for the raw data, session,
slide, micro and split caches used to reproduce the release.  Some cache
entries are explicitly recorded as missing; that is evidence of the historic
build environment, not permission to delete more cache.  Phase 8 must not
remove any manifest-referenced cache until raw Predictor parity and a revised,
verified reproduction contract exist.

## Current dependency graph

```text
Data CSV + cache/sessions + cache/splits + cache/slide + cache/micro15
  -> FilesystemDataSource / src.data.{loader,manifests,splits}
  -> runner.build_*_dataset
       -> event_stack macro feature/window model/density candidate generation
       -> imu_features + micro_cache micro ACC+GYRO model/candidates
       -> candidate_control (same-sid NMS and subject admission)
       -> context_features (fixed Context-v1 60 columns)
       -> runner verifier LogisticRegression + constrained LightGBM blend
       -> frozen policy / event decoder / official matching in event_stack
  -> scripts/crossfit_event_stack.py (nested-CV evidence)

  -> promotion_summary + promotion_attestation + incumbent registry
  -> scripts/release_event_stack.py -> scripts/package_event_stack.py
  -> dist/event_stack/{predict_event_stack.py,bundle,runtime_manifest.json}

test_context_features,test_imu_features,test_micro_cache,test_event_stack,
test_artifacts,test_event_stack_dist,test_release_event_stack}
  -> every bolded production/release layer above.
```

The canonical event-stack algorithm is already largely in `src/pipeline/`.
However, raw competition-file loading and end-to-end Predictor API are absent:
the current runtime CLI accepts serialized feature/candidate payloads, not raw
sensor files.  The duplicated `scripts/predict_event_stack.py` and
`dist/event_stack/predict_event_stack.py` have identical bytes today, but are
two maintained paths and must be canonicalized before release cleanup.

## Inventory and disposition (post-refactor, 2026-09-17)

Action column records the executed Phase 8 outcome.  Removed paths are
enumerated, with their six consumer proofs, in
`tests/fixtures/deletion_manifest.json`; removed files remain recoverable from
git history.

## Required parity boundaries for later phases

1. Existing registered nested-CV result must retain the five records and
   aggregate above; no threshold, admission, feature, imputation or matching
   change is allowed.
2. For legal existing session fixtures, compare preprocessing boundaries,
   macro `63`, micro `47`, Context-v1 `60`, verifier `116`, probabilities,
   admission and final decoded events between legacy current code, canonical
   `Predictor`, `dist/inference`, and `dist/submission`.
3. Verify every bundle manifest and promotion attestation before and after a
   structural commit.  The active runtime must still match the deployment
   manifest hash recorded by `dist/event_stack/runtime_manifest.json`.
4. Run tests with bytecode and pytest cache disabled; deletion may proceed only
   after the full suite and the clean-room inference/submission tests pass.

## Ambiguities and blockers to isolate, not guess

* **Task 3 macro producer parity record (2026-09-15):** a legal raw session was
  paired with `cache/sessions/` and `cache/slide/fold0_val.npz`.  The raw
  parser arrays equal the session cache and the legacy
  `scripts/slide_features.py:_process_session` output equals the selected 278
  slide rows, including finite float32 bytes and NaN representation.  The
  recorded fixture hashes and fingerprints are in
  `tests/fixtures/release_160afaf81debf1ee/fixture_manifest.json`.  However,
  the direct legacy producer/cache is **62-D**, while the frozen release's
  model-facing macro schema is **63-D** because `runner._with_time_prior`
  appends its one frozen column after cache loading.  The approved delivery
  plan resolves this as two immutable boundaries: a raw 62-D producer and the
  separate pure `add_time_prior` adapter.  Both matrices, schemas, the adapter
  fingerprint, windows and NaN-preserving bytes are locked by three-way parity
  tests; no model/policy behavior is implied by this structural split.

* **Official competition adapter:** `Resources/试题.txt` describes scoring,
  but this audit found no authoritative final machine input/output file schema
  or runner contract.  `dist/submission/main.py` must therefore isolate the
  adapter and declare a TODO; it must not invent the official format.
* **Raw input discovery:** existing data reading is organised around the
  repository's CSV/session-cache conventions.  A supported raw file/folder
  contract, including how multiple files form a session and how `sid` is
  supplied, must be documented and tested before `Predictor.predict_file()`
  can be claimed complete.
* **Current dist scope:** `dist/event_stack` is a validated standalone runtime
  only for serialized feature/candidate payloads.  It is not yet the raw-data
  inference workspace requested by the delivery specification.  Legacy files
  beside it cannot be deleted until their ownership is resolved.
* **Evidence location:** the current summary aliases are ignored runtime
  outputs while the immutable model-root summary/attestation are tracked.
  Do not mechanically move evidence to `outputs/release/`: first preserve or
  deliberately regenerate the attestation hash chain.

## Test baseline

Command launched from repository root with cache disabled:

```powershell
$env:PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE='1'
python -m pytest -p no:cacheprovider
```

Result: **299 passed, 2 skipped in 197.24s (0:03:17)**.  The command ran in a
separate retained process; its exit was observed after pytest printed the
complete summary.  This is the pre-refactor test baseline.  Deletion still
requires the same full suite plus the future raw Predictor and clean-room
distribution parity gates.
